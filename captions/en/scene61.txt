Johnny is walking along his island, when a schooner pulling a waterskiing woman sails up.
Johnny waves and jumps excitedly towards the four partygoers on the ship.
The ship pulls up, with multiple women and men drinking and partying.
Johnny swims up to the boat, and it sails off into the distance.
A short time later, the boat reappears, and a very intoxicated Johnny hops off the boat.
Johnny swims back to the island, before passing out under the coconut tree wearing a party hat and holding a martini glass.
