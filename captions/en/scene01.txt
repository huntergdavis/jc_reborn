Johnny climbs the lone palm tree on the island.
He pokes his head out of the fronds that top the tree.
Johnny jumps off of the tree like a diving board.
His flight starts out professionally, but quickly
his dive turns into a belly-flop with a splash.
The crabs and seagull which inhabit the island cheer
and raise dive scorecards, which range in score but are low.
Johnny swims back to the island to try again.
