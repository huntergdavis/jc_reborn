Johnny lays down to rest under the palm tree.
A 16th century three-mast ship sails into view.
Tiny lilliputians row ashore as Johnny sleeps.
They tie Johnny down to the island and sail away.
When Johnny awakes, he cannot move.
A seagull lands on Johnny, builds a nest, and lays an egg in the nest.
Johnny goes back to sleep.
