A yellow clock with a green frog on it appears, hands spinning wildly indicating the passage of time.
A tall redheaded woman is sunbathing in a bathing suit on an island outside the city.
She applies lotion to her legs, and relaxes on a green beach towel reading a book.
As she rests and reads her book, a message in a bottle floats towards her.
A question mark appears above her head, as she looks over to the bottle. 
She gets up, and strides over to the bottle.
She picks up the bottle, finding Johnny's note.
She imagines a giant island with a smouldering volcano.
She also imagines a very muscular, attractive man waiting for her.
In her dream, she is comically skinny, unlike in real life.
