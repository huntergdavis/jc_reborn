A cartoon clock with a front on it spins wildly, indicating the passage of time.
The island is siloutted by a radiant sunset.
An airplane flies by in shadow.
A lone figure parachutes out.
It's Johnny.
He lands back on his island, jumping up and down happily.
The words "The End" appear over the scene.
This concludes the story of Johnny Castaway.
