Johnny is behind his tree changing clothes.
Johnny appears wearing a stereotypical pacific islander ceremonial mask and grass skirt.
He begins to dance around, just as a man and a woman on a yaught appear to take photos.
They start taking photos of Johnny, and he begins to wave.
Johnny uses the palm frond from his grass skirt like a flag, waving down the ship.
This exposes Johnny's private parts.
Horrified, the man attempts to cover the woman's eyes on the yaught.
Johnny drops to his knees, begging them to take him away.
The yaught pulls away, with the man attempting to cover the woman's eyes and the woman waving back at Johnny happily.
