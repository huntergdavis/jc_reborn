Johnny builds a fire at the ends of his island.
Or he attempts to anyway, setting sticks and rubbing them together to attempt to create fire.
He tries  and  he tries.
Smoke appears.
Johnny blows on the smouldering wood.
A fire appears!
Johnny relaxes by the fire.
Johnny warms his hands by the fire.
The fire burns out.
Johnny walks around  his island.
