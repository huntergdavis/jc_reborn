Johnny is bathing in the ocean.
he washes his hair and uses a scrub brush on  his back.
His clothes are hanging on a stick on the beach.
A seagull is perched on the palm tree.
The seagull swoops down and steals Johnny's clothes for its nest.
Johnny shakes his fist in rage at the seagull,  then shivers angrily in the water.
