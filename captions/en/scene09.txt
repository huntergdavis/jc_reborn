Johnny is bathing in the ocean.
he washes his hair and uses a scrub brush on  his back.
He scrubs under his arms, then smells the brush in disgust.
His clothes are hanging on a stick on the beach.
He grabs his clothes, hides his nakedness behind them in a bunch and walks behind the tree.
Johnny then reappears from behind the tree.
He makes a "bell ringing" motion with his head and jaw.
