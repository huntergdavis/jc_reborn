Jonnh  walks around the island while a plane flies in the far distance.
Johnny jumps up and down excitedly waving at the plane, and throws a coconut at the plane in an attempt to get it's attention.
The plane crashes, the pilot parachuting into the distance.
Johnny holds his head in his hands despondently.
