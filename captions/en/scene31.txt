A cartoon clock with a front on it spins wildly, indicating the passage of time.
Johnny is in an office environment, typing at a computer wildly.
A giant stack of papers is in his inbox, and his outbox is empty.
There is a lone window, behind which a cityscape looms.
There is a large timeclock on the wall.
Johnny falls asleep, and dreams of his island and his time with the mermaid.
Johnny wakes up looking sad.
